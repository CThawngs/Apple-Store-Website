# Apple Store Website Remake

This project is a remake of the **Apple Store** website and represents one of my early steps in web development. It was created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my learning journey. As the first website I ever built, it reflects my foundational knowledge in these technologies and serves as a milestone in my growth as a developer.

## Overview

The project was primarily focused on understanding and applying basic concepts of web development such as:
- Structuring a webpage using **HTML**.
- Styling with **CSS**, including layout, typography, and design aesthetics.
- Adding interactivity with **JavaScript** for dynamic features like hover effects and simple animations.

This site was my first hands-on attempt, so while it may not be fully specialized or optimized, it captures the essence of learning and applying key concepts. Since then, my skills have advanced, and this project serves as a benchmark for tracking my progress.

- **Performance optimization** and code efficiency.
- **Advanced JavaScript functionality** for enhanced user experience.
- **Accessibility** improvements to ensure the site is usable for everyone.

## Conclusion

This project is a showcase of my foundational skills and growth in web development. While it's simple in design and function, it represents the starting point of my journey into web technologies, and I look forward to further refining my craft in future projects.
